<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

SkillLink is a community-driven platform where users can offer skills they're proficient in and request skills they want to learn. The core idea is to facilitate a barter economy for knowledge, connecting individuals for mutual growth without any monetary exchange. Our smart matching algorithm helps you find the perfect partner to start your learning journey.
